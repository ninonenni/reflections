How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it gives the exact place where i added / removed/ updated a line
    we should write diff -u <old> <new>

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    don't repeat tests or errors

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    is noce to have automatic commits when i pause editing
    the perfect manual commit should be for every logical change (in coding)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    git log --stat          	#give the status of all files
    git diff <old> <new>						# take care in git the newer 
    											commit is above the older one
    git config --global color.ui auto 			# to see colors
    git checkout <commit id>					# to checkout a version
    git init                                    # starts an new repository
    git status                                  # tells who is the head

    NB. Git doesn't initially create a commit .. need to do it myself
